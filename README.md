# Brain_tumor_classification

This engineering thesis focuses on developing a machine learning model for the detection of brain tumors using MRI images. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the implementation of deep learning techniques (e.g., CNNs) to accurately detect tumors. The goal is to assist medical professionals in early and accurate diagnosis. The repository includes code, and evaluation metrics.
